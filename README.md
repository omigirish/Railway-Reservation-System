# Railway-Reservation-System
Developed a Desktop Application for the Railway Management system using Java Swings. This application is built on Java(SE) and Mysql. This project was a part of my curriculum where I was required to demonstrate my knowledge of RDBMS(Mysql) and GUI design using Java. The application handles passenger reservations.

**NOTE**: You will have to Create a database in Mysql with the following Schema for this to work with a specific Schema.
